This includes my first original game called Whammer Hammer.
In the game, the main character is a guy named Leon. 
His hometown of Mallet (pronounced MAL-AY) is being overun by monsters taking the form of inanimate objects
Leon has to defeat the monsters with the help of his trusy Whammer Hammer.
The game works in a similar aspect to Cookie Clicker where the player clicks on the main hammer button to "wham" on their enemies.
There are multiple different enemies that player faces in their journey.
The first enemy is a nail called Whammer.
The second enemy is screw called Winder.
The third enemy is a spring called Whoopa
The last enemy is a whack a mole called Wuzzy
Once the player reaches and defeats the last enemy, they win!
There is also an difficulty setting with 3 different options consisting of Easy, Medium, and Hard.
This game is not completed by any means and I will continue to work on it as times goes by!
I hope you enjoy it!
